          [Wait for silence]
          <br />I’ll begin with a very brief overview of my first semester,
          during which I became interested in the concept of Software Services
          and the mediation of emotional crisis unfolding in hysterical users –
          exploring the professionalisation of users and the staging of
          technical support. [Wait 5 seconds and skip to the next page] It ended
          with the realisation that I had drifted away from the research area I
          had initially envisioned in my Sandberg application. Although I
          enjoyed the intuitive way of working, I felt unsettled by the lack of
          a theoretical foundation. It felt like I wove loose thoughts together
          into a more or less cohesive result and I wasn’t inspired enough to
          continue developing it further. That’s why, at the beginning of the
          second semester, I felt stuck in a dead end – with no clue how I got
          there, and how to get out. [Press ->]

          Luckily – and I am super thankful for this – the new classes
          encouraged us to take a fresh perspective onto our work through new
          tools and methods. I am also super grateful for how encouraging these
          sessions were. I think they helped me to fully commit to the
          collaboration with Adele and to establish both a conceptual framework
          plus a first iteration, which we can now built upon, using the super
          generous feedback we received after the midterms. Hopefully by the end
          of the summer break, we will have a second iteration ready to present
          at the public moment in September. This collaboration also helped me
          reconnect with my original interests, as I felt more aligned with the
          concept we developed together than I did with my first tryout in the
          first semester. I find it fascinating to reflect on the complex
          relationship between machines and humans, and their user-selves that
          are trapped within a pre-defined environment governed by the logic of
          software, which often leaves no room for ambiguity, flexibility or in
          interpretation in how users interact. I want to continue exploring
          these ideas in my summer draft and expand on the framework, I have
          tried to lay out in my outline, which I would like to give you a
          little insight into now. [Press ->] I have already tried thinking in
          physical terms and developed a few experiments, one of which is this
          theatre souffleur/prompting box you see here. It might make more sense
          once I have explained the core idea behind my outline. (It’s been
          running the whole time, though I am not sure if I’ve stayed in sync.
          Probably not) [Press ->]

          The central question I would like to ask is: Whose body is performing
          the script? I want to explain this with a bit more context but I also
          want to mention that I am still in the early stages of my thesis, so
          some parts may be undeveloped and unclear. My inquiry relates to the
          previously described technological conditions shaping the relationship
          between humans (or users) and machines—and how those conditions
          influence behavior. In this question, I use „body“ as a non-specific
          term to refer to the user, while also opening up two lines of
          interpretation. First, it could relate to the identity of WHO is the
          person: is the user the SAME as the performer? Second, it can be
          understood in a possessive sense: to WHOM does the body belong that is
          performing the script? Is it the user’s OWN body performing, or is it
          the choreographer’s vision/intent coming through them?Ultimately, this
          raises broader questions around agency and influence, authorship and
          autonomy. [Press ->]I would like to draw a conceptual comparison with
          characteristics of performative practices in theatre plays, where
          performances are considered as a laid-out instruction scripts and are
          carried out as a twice behaved or stored, recalled and embodied
          behaviour. These are executed by a body of a performer who behave as
          someone else, as another version of „me“. [Press ->] With this thesis,
          I am proposing that in the relationship between humans and machines,
          users are performing actors – playing roles dictated by a screenplay
          script of the programmer, who acts as a kind of dramaturg. In other
          words computation determines which role we are playing and how we
          “behave.” Building on this analogy, I would like to explore how we
          might resist/refuse or escape this rigid environment in order to gain
          agency by asking: Does the abstractness of a software script allow for
          misinterpretation? Where do moments of impulsiveness, improvisation or
          spontaneity emerge (off-script and free-style!)? Who is the audience?
          Who is the protagonist and who is the supporting cast? Is there a
          possibility of collaboration between user-performer and
          programmer-dramaturg? Who is the voice inside the prompter? And Who is
          the stunt double?
