          1 [Wait for silence] I’ll begin with a very short overview of my first
          semester, during which I got interested in the concept of Software
          Services and the mediation of emotional crisis unfolding in hysterical
          users – touching on the professionalisation of users + staging of
          technical support. [Wait 5 seconds and skip to the next page] It ended
          with the realisation that I had drifted away from the research area I
          had initially envisioned in my Sandberg application. Although I
          enjoyed the intuitive approach of working, I was unsettled by the lack
          of a theoretical foundation. It felt like loose thoughts weaved
          together into a more or less cohesive result and I wasn’t inspired
          enough to continue developing it further. That’s why, at the beginning
          of the second semester, I felt stuck in a dead end – with no clue how
          I got there and how to get out. [Press ->] 
          <p>But luckily and I am
          super thankful, that the new classes forced us to get another
          perspective onto our works with new tools and methods. I am also super
          grateful of how encouraging these sessions were. I think this helped
          me to really invest in the collaboration with Adele and in
          establishing a conceptual framework plus a first iteration we can now
          built on and use the super generous feedback we got after the
          midterms. And hopefully by the end of the summer break we will have a
          second iteration that we can show at the public moment in
          September/October. I think this collaboration also helped me to find
          my way back to my initial interest because I felt more related to the
          concept we developed compared to my first tryout in the first
          semester. I find it fascinating to reflect on the weird relation
          between machines and humans and their user-selfs that are trapped
          within a pre-defined environment governed by the logic of software,
          which often leave no room for ambiguity, flexibility or in
          interpretation in how users interact. I would like to continue
          exploring these ideas in my summer draft and built on the framework to
          critically engage with the technological spaces, I have tried to lay
          out in my outline, which I would like to give you a little peek now.
          [Press ->] I already tried to think in physical matters as well and
          develop a few experiments, one which is this theatre
          souffleur/prompting box you see here, which maybe makes sense when I
          have explained my thesis assertion. (Which has been running the whole
          time, though I am not sure if I’ve stayed in sync. Probably not)
          [Press ->] </p>
        <p>My central question I would like to ask, is: Whose body
          is performing the script? I would like to explain this with a bit more
          context but I also want to disclaim that I am at the start of this
          thesis and there might be some flaws or things that doesn’t make sense
          yet. My inquiry relates to the previously explained technological
          conditions of human/user in relation to machines and their scripted
          influence. Im this question I use „body“ as a non specific term to
          address the user and to open the question into two directions. First
          it could relate to the identity of WHO is the person. Is it the SAME
          person as the performer? And secondly you can understand it as a
          possessive form – to WHOM does the body belong that is performing the
          script? Is it THEIR body performing, or is it the choreographer’s
          vision/intent coming through them? All in all it raises questions of
          agency and influence, authorship and autonomy. I would like to draw a
          conceptual comparison with the characteristics of a performative
          practices of theatre plays where performances are considered as a
          laid-out instruction and a twice behaved or stored and recalled
          (embodied) behaviour executed by a body of a performer who is behaving
          as someone else, as another „me“. With my thesis I want to make the
          assertion that in the relationship between humans and machines, the
          users are performing actors, playing a role and are controlled by the
          screenplay, the script of the programmer as dramaturge.In other words
          computation dictates who’s role we are playing and how we “behave.”
          Based on this analogy, I would like to reflect on the opportunities to
          escape/refuse this rigid environment in order to gain more agency by
          asking: Does the abstractness of a (software) script hold the
          possibility of misinterpretation? Where are moments of impulsiveness
          in improvisation/off-script/spontaneity/free-style? Where and who is
          the audience? Who is the protagonist and who is the supporting cast?
          Is there a possibility of collaboration between user-performer and
          programmer-dramaturg? Who is the voice inside the prompter? And Who is
          the stunt-double? [End of text] I hope now this little prompter box
          made a bit more sense. And I would like to go to my second experiment,
          that I would like to show and read out loud to you now. With this next
          experiment I refer to the idea of script-misinterpretation as a way of
          refusal. For this I built this tool that sabotages a text in a pdf.
          And for now I used a text I created in Tinas class. I hope it works.</p>
